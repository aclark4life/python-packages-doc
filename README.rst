Introduction
============

In this documentation we introduce and explain ``pythonpackages.com`` to its target
audience: Python developers.

What is it?
-----------

``pythonpackages.com`` began on October 29th, 2011 as a web front end for
various command line utilities that query the Python Package Index to obtain various
statistics about Python packages, like number of downloads. Soon after that, a fun
(but crude) package ratings system was added; as well as the ability to leave
comments on each package's "info" page. In addition to querying the Python Package
Index, we also query the following websites for package information (and
cache the results):

  - http://django.opencomparison.org
  - http://plone.opencomparison.org
  - http://pyramid.opencomparison.org
  - http://readthedocs.org
  - http://packages.python.org

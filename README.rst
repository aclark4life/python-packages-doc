Introduction
============

In this documentation we introduce and explain ``pythonpackages.com`` to its target
audience: Python developers.

What is it?
-----------

``pythonpackages.com`` began on October 29th, 2011 as a web front end for
various command line utilities that query the `Python Package Index`_ to obtain various
statistics about Python packages, like number of downloads. Utilities include:

  - http://pythonpackages.com/info/vanity
  - http://pythonpackages.com/info/yolk
  - http://pythonpackages.com/info/zopyx.trashfinder

After that, a `package featuring system`_ was added; as well as the ability to leave
comments on each package's "info" page (via `disqus.com`_). In addition to querying the
`Python Package Index`_, we also query the following websites for documentation:

  - http://django.opencomparison.org
  - http://plone.opencomparison.org
  - http://pyramid.opencomparison.org
  - http://readthedocs.org
  - http://packages.python.org

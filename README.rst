Introduction
============

In this documentation we introduce and explain ``pythonpackages.com`` to its target
audience: Python developers.

What is it?
===========

``pythonpackages.com`` began in mid-November 2011 as a web front end for
various
command line utilities that query the Python Package Index to obtain various
statistics about Python packages, like number of downloads.

Soon after that, a fun
(but crude) package ratings system was added; and folks have been favoriting packages
ever since (some are even cheating!)

Finally, in addition to the Python Package
Index, we also query (and cache) the following sites for package information:

  - http://opencomparison.org sites (i.e. Django, Plone, Pyramid)
  - http://readthedocs.org projects (\\o/)
  - http://packages.python.org projects

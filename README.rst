In this documentation we introduce and explain ``pythonpackages.com`` to its target
audience: Python developers.

What is it?
===========

``pythonpackages.com`` began in mid-November 2011 as a web front end for
various command line utilities that query the Python Package Index to obtain various
statistics about Python packages, like number of downloads. Soon after that, a fun
(but crude) package ratings system was added; as well as the ability to comment on
each package's "info" page. And in addition to the Python Package
Index, we also query (and cache) the following sites for package information:

  - http://plone.opencomparison.org
  - http://pyramid.opencomparison.org
  - http://readthedocs.org
  - http://packages.python.org

What do most Python programmers do for a living? They build things: services,
software, systems, etc. How can we make building things easier for everyone involved?

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First let us not debate about which tool is best. We have lots of **tools** in
the Python world. What we are missing is **clarity**. Rather than force people to use
a particular tool without explaining why, let us *better* explain what tools
are available, and let folks decide for themselves which ones they would like to use.

Hosted configuration files
--------------------------

In addition to its `basic features`_, pythonpackages.com provides a set of shared, extendable
configuration files for building Python and other software. Please continue reading to learn more.

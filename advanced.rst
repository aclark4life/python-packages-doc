What do most Python programmers do for a living? They build things: services,
software, systems, etc. How can we make building things easier for everyone involved?

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First let us not debate about which tool is best. We have lots of **tools** in
the Python world. What we are missing is **clarity**. Rather than force people to use
a particular tool without explaining why, let us *better* explain what tools
are available and let folks decide for themselves which ones they would like to use.

In the case of ``zc.buildout`` and ``pip``, we can demonstrate their usage by
publishing some common configuration files for various popular software.

Hosted configuration files
--------------------------

So in addition to its core features, ``pythonpackages.com`` provides a set of shared,
extendable configuration files for building Python-based and other software.
Please continue reading to see examples.

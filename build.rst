Building things
===============

What do most Python programmers do for a living? They build things: services,
software, systems, etc. How can we make building things easier for everyone involved?

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First let us not debate about which tool is best. We have lots of **tools** in
the Python world. What we are missing is **clarity**. Rather than force people to use
a particular tool without explaining why, let us *better* explain what tools
are available, and let folks decide for themselves which ones they would like to use.

Hosted configuration files
--------------------------

Whilst zc.buildout has established itself is a quality tool amongst those that
use it, it's still seen as competition to other tools (e.g. pip). It should not
be seen this way. It has many advanced features and should be seen as something
you use when nothing else does what you need.

So in addition to a :ref:`package featuring system`, ``pythonpackages.com``
provides a set of shared, extendable configuration files for building Python and other
software. Please continue reading to learn more.

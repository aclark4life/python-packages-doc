Building things
===============

What do most Python programmers do for a living? They build things: services,
software, systems, etc. How can we make building things easier for everyone involved?

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First of all, let us not debate about which tool is best. We have lots of **tools** in
the Python world. What we are missing is **clarity**. Rather than force people to use
a particular tool without explaining why, let us *better* explain what tools are available
and let folks decide for themselves which ones they would like to use.

Sounds great! But how?

Hosted configuration files
--------------------------

In addition to a :ref:`package featuring system`_, ``pythonpackages.com``
provides a set of shared, extendable configuration files for building Python and other
software. Please continue reading to learn more.

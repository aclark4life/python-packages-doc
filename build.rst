Building things
===============

What do most Python programmers do for a living? They build things (services,
software, systems, etc.) How can we make building things easier for everyone involved?

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First of all, let us end the debate **once and for all** about which tool is
best. We have lots of tools in the Python world. What we are missing is **clarity**. 

Rather than force people to use a particular tool without explaining why, let
us *better* explain what tools are available and let folks decide for themselves
which ones they would like to use.

Sounds great! But how?
----------------------

``pythonpackages.com`` provides resources to explain how various tools work.
The project is in its infancy, but already contains something of
significant value:

- Shared, extendable configuration files for building Python (and other)
  software.

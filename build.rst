Building things
===============

What do most Python programmers do for a living? They build things; services,
software, systems, etc. How can we make building things easier for everyone involved?

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First of all, let us end the debate **once and for all** about which tool is
best. What we have in the Python world is lots of tools.
What we are missing is **clarity**. 

Rather than force people to use a particular tool without explaining why, let
us *better* explain what tools are available, and let folks decide for themselves
which ones they would like to use (along with understanding why they
would like to use them!)

Sounds great! But how?
----------------------

``pythonpackages.com`` aims to help by providing a resource for
folks to see examples of how all the various build tools work. Not only that,
it aims to provide a resource for programmers to share that knowledge amongst
themselves. This project is in its infancy, but already contains something of
significant value:

- Shared, extendable configuration files for building Python (and other)
  software.

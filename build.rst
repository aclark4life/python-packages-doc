Building things
===============

What do most of us do for a living? We build things. How can we make building
things easier for everyone involved? I am glad you asked.

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First of all, let us end the debate **once and for all**: what we have available
in the Python world is **tools**. Lots and lots of tools. What we are missing is
**clarity**. Rather than force people to use a particular tool without explaining why, let
us *better* explain what tools are available, and let folks decide for themselves
which ones they would like to use (along with understanding why they
would like to use them!)

Sounds great! But how?
----------------------

``pythonpackages.com`` aims to help by providing a resource for
folks to see examples of how all the various build tools work. Not only that,
it aims to provide a resource for sharing that knowledge. This project is in
its infancy, but already contains something of significant value:

- Shared, extendable configuration files for building Python (and other)
  software.

Building things
===============

What do most Python programmers do for a living? They build things (services,
software, systems, etc.) How can we make building things easier for everyone involved?

Buildout/easy_install vs. virtualenv/pip
----------------------------------------

First of all, let us end the debate **once and for all** about which tool is
best. We have lots of **tools** in the Python world. What we are missing is **clarity**. 

Rather than force people to use a particular tool without explaining why, let
us *better* explain what tools are available and let folks decide for themselves
which ones they would like to use.

Sounds great! But how?
----------------------

In addition to showcasing Python packages, ``pythonpackages.com`` provides a resource to
demonstrate how various tools work together. The project is in its infancy, but
already offers something of significant value:

- Shared, extendable configuration files for building Python (and other)
  software.

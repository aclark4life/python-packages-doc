Step 2: Add package slot and select repository

Step 3: Test release
--------------------

* Beware: there is no magic, yet. In addition to selecting a working package, you should add a MANIFEST.in file to your package if you have not done so already. pythonpackages.com does not know or care about any version control integration you may be using.

* Send the release to the test index server with the "Test release" button. You should see:

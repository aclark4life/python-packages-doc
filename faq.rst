Q: How does pythonpackages.com differ from the Python Package Index (PyPI)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** pythonpackages.com is not a package index, i.e. we do not host any files for download. We consume their (PyPI) API to display useful information about packages, as well as provide additional services to Python programmers to help package and release their software.

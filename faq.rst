Q: How do you make money?
-------------------------
**A:** Developers are encouraged to use the free plan which includes a single "package slot" to evaluate the service. If the service provides significant value, they are encouraged to purchase a paid plan which includes some number of paid slots, depending on the plan. Additionally, paid plans allow access to some number of GitHub organization repositories, depending on the plan.

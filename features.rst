Features
========

This section provides an overview of ``pythonpackages.com``'s features.

Display number of downloads
---------------------------

In its simplest form, ``pythonpackages.com`` allows you to enter a Python
package name:

Then it tells you the number of times that package has been downloaded from
the Python Package Index:

Exciting! ;-)

.. _`package featuring system`:

Package featuring system
------------------------

The process of entering a package name on ``pythonpackages.com`` causes it to be displayed
in a list of recent entries, effectively "featuring" it.

You can also feature packages via the "Feature it" or "Feature package"
buttons.

Exciting too!

Display number of times featured
--------------------------------

In addition to displaying the number of times a package has been downloaded from
the Python Package Index, ``pythonpackages.com`` displays the number of times a
package has been featured on ``pythonpackages.com``. Just click on a package's 
"featured" link in the "Recent entries" section, or one of the packages listed
under the "Most downloaded" column to the left.

Exciting three! ;-)

Thus, we have described three core features of ``pythonpackages.com``:

  - Display the number of times a package has been downloaded from the
    Python package index.
  - Provide a package "featuring" system.
  - Display the number of times a package has been featured.

Python 3 wall of praise
-----------------------

`pythonpackages.com`_ wants to encourage folks to use Python 3.
As such, we have implemented a ``Python 3 Wall of Praise``. It looks like this:

Enter your favorite package and if its metadata indicates
Python 3 support, the entry will be highlighted.

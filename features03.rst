Display number of times featured
--------------------------------

In addition to displaying the number of times a package has been downloaded from
the Python Package Index, `pythonpackages.com`_ displays the number of times a
package has been featured on `pythonpackages.com`_. Just click on a package's 
"featured" link in the "Recent entries" section, or one of the packages listed
under the "Most downloaded" column to the left.

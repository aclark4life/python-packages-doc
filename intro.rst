History
-------

`pythonpackages.com`_ began in October 2011 as a web front end to the `vanity`_ command line utility, which queries the `Python Package Index`_ for package download statistics. Shortly after that, two more utilities were added:

- http://pythonpackages.com/package/yolk
- http://pythonpackages.com/package/zopyx.trashfinder

Next, a :ref:`package featuring` system was added to allow users to feature their favorite Python packages. Followed by a `package commenting system`_, that allows users to comment on their favorite packages. Finally, in addition to querying the `Python Package Index`_, we also provide links to `documentation`_, `comparison grids`_ and `downloadable files`_ by querying the following sites:

- http://crate.io
- http://django.opencomparison.org
- http://plone.opencomparison.org
- http://pyramid.opencomparison.org
- http://packages.python.org
- http://readthedocs.org

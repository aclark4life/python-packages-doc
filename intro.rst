History
-------

`pythonpackages.com`_ began in October 2011 as a web front end for
various command line utilities that query the `Python Package Index`_ to obtain various
statistics about Python packages, like number of downloads. Utilities used include:

  - http://pythonpackages.com/info/vanity
  - http://pythonpackages.com/info/yolk
  - http://pythonpackages.com/info/zopyx.trashfinder

After that, a :ref:`package featuring system` was added; as well as the ability to leave
comments on each package's information page (via `disqus.com`_). In addition to querying the
`Python Package Index`_, we also provide links to documentation and `comparison grids`_ by
querying these sites:

  - http://packages.python.org
  - http://readthedocs.org
  - http://django.opencomparison.org
  - http://plone.opencomparison.org
  - http://pyramid.opencomparison.org

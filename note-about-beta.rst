.. Note:: The beta release features should be available to anyone who has `signed up for the beta`_. pythonpackages.com checks your GitHub email address against your beta signup email address. However, the GitHub API currently only returns an email address if you've configured one to display publicly here: https://github.com/settings/profile. If you have signed up for the beta before July 9 2012 (afterward the form requires your GitHub username), but don't want to display your email to the public, please `open a ticket`_ and include your GitHub username. We will whitelist your account.
